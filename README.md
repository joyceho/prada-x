## Research Group

We analyze and mine complex, heterogenous data to explore, characterize, and understand the underlying states / processes. Our approaches are based on statistical machine learning and data mining that work on a variety of real-life applications with a focus on healthcare applications.

We are always looking for motivated and hard-working students (graduate and undergraduate students) to do research with us. _If you are at Emory and interested in joining our lab, send an e-mail titled "More Data More Fun" with your CV, unofficial transcript, and your particular research interest to Joyce Ho_. Note that we will only consider those who have taken either Data Structure & Algorithms (CS323) or Machine Learning (CS534). If you are not at Emory yet, please apply to the CSI graduate program first.
